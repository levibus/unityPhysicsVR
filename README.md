A set of virtual reality physics demos made in Unity for the University of Nebraska-Lincoln physics dept.

# cubeRamp
This scene contains a block that slides down a ramp. The block has freebody diagram arrows on it, such as the velocity, normal, friction, and x and y gravity component vectors. The arrows, board, and block can all have their visibility turned on and off. The angle of the ramp can be changed, and the static and dynamic coefficients of friction on the cube can be changed.

This demonstration is designed to be paired with a physical demonstration of the same setup, so that the physical cube can have the freebody diagram overlayed on it as it slides down the physical ramp. Unfortunately, the Oculus headset doesn't allow for object tracking, so this demonstration simply lines up the components of friction between the physical and virtual demonstrations so that the virtual arrows respond well to the movement of the physical block.
